# Personalized email Generation Assistant
This project is an AI-powered system designed to automatically generate personalized, high-quality email drafts for use cases such as internship applications, research emails, professional communication, and follow-ups. The goal is to reduce manual effort while maintaining a human-like, context-aware writing style. The system supports personalized inputs like recipient name, topic, and intent, and can be easily integrated into larger automation workflows. The repository includes scripts for generating emails, evaluating generated outputs, handling assistant logic, managing fine-tuned models, and storing evaluation results.

Typical use cases include bulk professional email drafting, cold outreach automation, internship and research communication, and smart email reply systems. The project is implemented in Python and can work with prompt-based generation or fine-tuned language models. Users can run the main script to generate emails, evaluate model performance using the evaluation script, and extend the system with custom templates or models.

To use the project, clone the repository from GitHub, install dependencies (if any), and run the email generation script from the terminal or your Python environment. The output emails and evaluation data are stored inside structured folders for easy tracking. This project is ideal for students, researchers, and developers working on AI-driven communication tools, GenAI workflows, and automation systems.
